# Stringify Module
![Stringy!](item:tisstring:string_module)

The Stringify module turns the input into a null-terminated string

- Signed 16 (int)
- Unsigned 16 (unit)
- Half-Prescision Float (FLT)

Cycling through the selected functions is done by holding the item in your hand and right-clicking. Cycling backwards can be done by right-clicking while sneaking. 

Calculating the outputs of these functions is done by writing the input value to the module, at which point the module will write the output to all ports one at a time.
